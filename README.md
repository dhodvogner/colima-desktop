# Colima Desktop

[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)'s desktop utility.

## Project Goals

I'd like to keep this as simple as possible.
At the moment, I don't have any plans to add any fancy features. (Like listing containers, images, etc.)

Currently, I'm only targeting macOS. (But maybe Windows and Linux will be supported in the future.)

## Features

- âœ… Start/Stop/Restart Colima
- âœ… Display Colima status (Running, Stopped, Starting, Stopping, Restarting)
- âœ… Animated Colima tray icon
- ðŸ“‹ Collect and view Colima logs
- ðŸ“‹ Colima settings
  - Launch Colima Desktop at login
  - Colima start arguments
  - Colima version
