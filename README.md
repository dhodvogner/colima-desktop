# Colima Desktop

[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)'s desktop utility.

## Project Goals

I'd like to keep this as simple as possible.
At the moment, I don't have any plans to add any fancy features. (Like listing containers, images, etc.)

Currently, I'm only targeting macOS. (But maybe Windows and Linux will be supported in the future.)

## Features

- âœ… Start/Stop/Restart Colima via the CLI command
- âœ… Display Colima status (Running, Stopped, Starting, Stopping, Restarting)
- âœ… Animated tray icon
- ðŸ“‹ Logging
  - âœ… Save and view logs (from the Colima CLI)
  - ðŸ“‹ Clear logs
- ðŸ“‹ Colima settings
  - âœ… Colima start arguments
  - âœ… Colima path
  - ðŸ“‹ Launch Colima Desktop at login
  - ðŸ“‹ Colima version
  - ðŸ“‹ Settings design

âœ… = Implemented

ðŸ“‹ = Planned
